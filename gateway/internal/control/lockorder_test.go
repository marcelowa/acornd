// Building a state must not read the registry while holding a control's own lock.
//
// The eviction sweep takes the registry lock and then reads each control, so reading the
// registry from inside a control's lock makes two orders out of one pair of locks. A
// pending writer on either side then closes the cycle, and one state build, one sweep, and
// one frame arriving together hang every request that touches both — which is every
// request. It is not a theoretical hazard: this happened, and the interface sat on
// "connecting" until the process was killed.
//
// Checked instead of timed. A deadlock is not something a test can assert on directly,
// only wait for, and waiting gets the answer wrong in both directions: a lock held briefly
// looks fine, and a lock starved by a busy writer looks fatal. Here the registry callback
// asks the control's lock whether it is free, which is true exactly when the registry is
// being read from outside it. No timing, no goroutines, no flakes.

// StateFor renders every conversation's row while holding its snapshot read lock, and the

// after a queued writer behind that writer, so the second acquisition waits for a writer that
// is waiting for the first — held by this same goroutine — and every request behind it waits
// too. The production shape was one state request and one event-stream subscribe; the control
// lock wedged, the eviction sweep then held the registry lock while waiting on the control,
// and the interface sat on "harness down" until the process was killed.
//
// Checked without waiting on a deadlock: a writer is parked on the lock for the whole inner
// call, which is exactly what a queued writer looks like, and the build must still finish.
