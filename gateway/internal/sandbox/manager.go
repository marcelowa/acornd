// Package sandbox keeps every model-driven touch of the world inside one microVM per
// workspace: commands, file reads, file writes, and the workspace's own resource files.
// See docs/adr/0012-sandbox.md for the decision and the measurements behind it.
//
// Two sides, one engine. Control owns the sandbox's life with the engine's command line
// (this package: install the engine, create, start, stop, remove) and the worker owns
// execution inside it with the engine's SDK (worker/src). The two speak to the same engine
// and the same state, which is why one side can be Go and the other JavaScript.
//
// Nothing above this file names an engine. `Driver` is the seam: a different sandbox — a
// different microVM manager, a container runtime, bubblewrap where there is no hypervisor —
// is a new file implementing it, not a change to control, the interface, or the worker's
// contract.
