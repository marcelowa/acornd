# ADR 0018 — Disable VM nesting: an opt-out, granted by the engine and the machine

Status: accepted, built — live on the interim 0.7.6 pin; the `--nested-virt` switch arms
when the pin moves
Date: 2026-10-09

## Context

A sandbox cannot hand its guest the virtualization CPU flag by itself. The engine has to ask
its hypervisor for nesting — the flag's presence in the guest is what a nested `/dev/kvm`
needs — and the machine has to be able to grant it: a Linux host with VT-x or AMD-V and
`nested` enabled on its KVM module, or an Apple Silicon M3 or later on macOS 15+.

The engine acornfall pins, microsandbox 0.7.6, has no switch at all: its guests nest whenever
the machine can. Its successors 0.7.7 and 0.7.8 added a CPUID mask to their krun crate with
the flag off and no way to ask for it, so their guests never nest — the regression upstream
recorded as [#1778](https://github.com/superradcompany/microsandbox/issues/1778). The
upstream fix is [microsandbox#823](https://github.com/superradcompany/microsandbox/pull/823):
`msb create --nested-virt`, off by default, "startup fails if the host cannot honor an
enabled setting". It is blocked on
[libkrun#155](https://github.com/superradcompany/libkrun/pull/155) and
[libkrunfw#32](https://github.com/superradcompany/libkrunfw/pull/32), and no release carries
it — v0.7.8, the latest, still has no flag. 0.7.6 is pinned on purpose, not left behind: a
sandbox nests today, while the switch that would make it a choice is still upstream.

This surfaced from use, not from theory: acornfall is developed inside an acornfall workspace,
and its own sandbox tier (`make test-sandbox`) needs `/dev/kvm` inside that workspace's guest.

## Decision

A per-workspace `disable_vm_nesting`. Absent or false allows nesting wherever it can be
granted; true refuses it. There is no install-wide switch: a refusal belongs to a workspace, and
a machine-wide one only made sense while every workspace was the same decision.
Nesting is allowed unless refused, and the refusal behaves in three ways:

- **Asked only where it can be granted.** The engine is told `--nested-virt` when it offers
  the flag and the machine can nest; otherwise the sandbox boots without it. A default must
  not cost anybody their workspace, and the hosts that cannot nest are common: M1/M2 Macs,
  cloud VMs, CI runners, machines with the host kernel's `nested` off.
- **Refused explicitly.** A workspace that turns nesting off is told to the engine anyway,
  `--nested-virt=false`, the way `network: none` is written out so an engine default cannot
  overrule a workspace.
- **Silent only when it must be.** What is decided is said: `doctor` prints availability and
  the reason it is not, and the workspace state carries whether the next sandbox will nest
  (`nested`) or why it will not (`nestedReason`). A workspace that allows nesting and does
  not get it is a sentence, not a surprise. A workspace that disables nesting carries
  neither: its own setting, visible beside the state, is the reason.

Nesting is decided when a sandbox is created; changing the setting applies to the next
sandbox, exactly like the image, because the running sandbox is where dependencies live.

## Alternatives

**Nesting as a requirement.** Rejected: upstream's semantics for an enabled setting is that
startup fails when the host cannot honor it. Requiring nesting would mean every sandbox
creation failing on every host that cannot nest — for workspaces that never wanted a VM
inside a VM.

**Disabled by default.** Rejected as the default, though both the flag and the field exist.
The projects that want nesting are the ones this product is for — developing acornfall
itself, emulators, container-in-sandbox work — a wrong guess is cheap by construction (the
sandbox boots, the surfaces say why not), and the machine-level answer is one word to
change. The engine's own default is off because it cannot know the host; acornfall can look.

**Deeper checks than we do.** Deferred: the host checks are deliberately conservative (a
kernel parameter, a chip generation) and answer "no" when they are unsure, which is the safe
direction. The engine's own check remains the authority once the flag is passed.

## Consequences

- On the pinned 0.7.6 there is no switch and guests nest whenever the machine can, so
  `doctor` and the state report `nested: true` wherever the host half agrees — the truth,
  while the pin lasts. A workspace that disables nesting still gets a nesting-capable
  sandbox there: no off switch exists to honor it with. Moving the pin to the release
  carrying `--nested-virt` arms both directions, and the commit that moves it should say so.
- `acornfall doctor` grows a nesting line, text and JSON; the state frame grows two fields.
- The install-wide switch is gone (it was `--disable-vm-nesting`): a workspace decides, and
  a refusal is recorded on the workspace rather than on the machine. The remaining difference
  is still on purpose: acornfall's setting says what it refuses,
  the engine's `--nested-virt` says what it does with a sandbox.
- Tests: the machines' answers (Linux KVM parameters, Apple chip and OS version) are pure
  functions, tested on every platform; the create path — the flag, the explicit false, or
  nothing — is pinned against a fake engine.
