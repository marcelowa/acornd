 * A workspace's sandbox, as the worker sees it: the only way it touches the workspace.

 * The worker runs on the host, next to the provider credential, and has no host path to the
 * workspace at all. Everything the model asks for — a command, a file — goes through here
 * and happens inside the sandbox, where the workspace is the only host folder mounted and
 * the machine holds nothing else of ours. See docs/adr/0012-sandbox.md.
 *
 * This file is the contract, and it names no engine. An engine is one module implementing
 * `SandboxClient` plus a way to open one — `microsandbox.ts` and `host.ts` today, which are
 * also where the engine-specific code lives. Control picks the engine and passes its name to
 * the worker, so both sides of one install use the same one; a second engine is a second file
 * here and a second `Driver` in gateway/internal/sandbox.
