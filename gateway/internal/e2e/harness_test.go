// Package e2e drives a real gateway, a real worker, and a scripted provider over HTTP. It
// is the only place a feature is exercised through every layer at once: the flags a person
// runs it with, the JSONL worker protocol, the durable store, and the tool loop.
//
// What it deliberately is not: a unit test. Anything that can be decided without a process
// belongs in the package that owns the rule, where it runs in microseconds. These tests
// exist for the things that only break when the layers disagree — a frame that is not
// published, a resolution that is not applied, a restart that loses a run.
//
// Nothing here touches the network or a provider: `faux/faux-1` is scripted, so a failing
// test is reproducible and free.
