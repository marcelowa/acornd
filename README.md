# Acornfall

A personal assistant platform: a Go gateway and control plane over a pluggable
agent harness.

```
web client ──HTTP+SSE──► gateway (Go) ──► control ──JSONL/stdio──► worker (bun, pi-durable)
```

The harness is a provider behind the worker protocol. Replacing it means writing
another worker, not changing the control plane.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `docs/adr/` | Decisions. Read `0001-concepts.md` first. |
| `gateway/` | Go: transport edge, control plane, worker supervision, embedded client. |
| `worker/` | bun: the Harness, its registry (tools, skills), and credentials. |
| `gateway/web/` | The embedded interface: the built bundle the gateway serves. |
| `ui/` | The interface itself: React, tokens, Storybook. Built by `make ui-build`. |
| `tools/` | Browser-driven checks. |

## Requirements

- Go 1.27+ (exact version in `gateway/go.mod`)
- bun 1.4+
- make, gcc (builds and the `-race` tests)
- an API key for a supported provider (or the dev provider below)
- one sandbox engine, and the engine a new workspace gets is the first one this machine can
  actually run ([ADR 0026](docs/adr/0026-rootless-host.md)):
  - `bwrap` — `apt install bubblewrap passt`, no root needed beyond that. On Ubuntu 23.10+ it also
    needs unprivileged user namespaces: `sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0`
    (or an AppArmor profile for `/usr/bin/bwrap`, which covers a workspace with no egress)
  - `microsandbox` — a hypervisor: `/dev/kvm`, and your user in the `kvm` group

## Setup

First, ask the machine what it needs — and let it fix it:

```bash
acornfall setup     # probes, then asks for your password only for the steps that need root
```

It names each step before asking (install `bubblewrap passt`, allow user namespaces, make
`/dev/net/tun` available, add you to `kvm`, keep your services after logout), runs only the
missing ones through `sudo`, then probes again and tells you what is left — a new group needs a
new login, and nothing can change that for you. Where a password cannot be asked for (no `sudo`,
or no terminal), it prints the same steps as copy-pasteable commands instead.

Already root? No password exists, so the plan is what you approve: it shows the steps and asks
`apply these steps? [y/N]` (`--yes` for a script). Either way it checks the account that runs
acornfall, not the one typing: the owner of the acornfall folder, `--for USER` to say otherwise.
Root can open `/dev/kvm` and make a user namespace whatever the policy says, so a check run as
root would report a machine that works while the service's workspaces cannot boot.

Then:

```bash
# Go: https://go.dev/dl — match the version in gateway/go.mod
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash  # bun, into ~/.bun/bin
sudo apt install make gcc                  # Debian/Ubuntu build tools

make deps    # bun install in worker/, ui/, tools/
make tools   # the linters make lint runs (staticcheck, worker deps)
```

`bun` must stay on `PATH` for development: with `ACORNFALL_WORKER` pointing at the sources the
gateway starts workers with system bun, and a worker fails to start without it. Releases
need no bun and no sources: the gateway downloads a pinned bun once and
the worker tarball per release, both under the install folder
(`~/.acornfall` by default), and installs dependencies itself. Migrate
scripts bake into the binary. Nothing lives outside the install folder.

## Run

```bash
make deps                      # bun install in worker/
make build                     # go build -> ./bin/acornfall

echo "$OPENCODE_API_KEY" | ./bin/acornfall provider add opencode-go
./bin/acornfall start           # http://<host>:7777
```

Every command answers `-h`, and `acornfall` with no arguments lists them:

```
start      run the gateway
setup      check this machine, and make it able to run sandboxes
doctor     report what the sandbox engines can do here; changes nothing
workspace  list, add, and remove workspaces
secret     list, add, show, rotate, and remove secrets
provider   list, add, and remove model provider keys
model      list or choose the default model
update     check for a release, and install it
version    print the running version
```

### Sandbox engines

A workspace runs on one engine, chosen when it is created and kept with its record:

| engine | what it is | needs |
|---|---|---|
| `microsandbox` | one microVM per workspace (the default, and the strongest boundary) | `/dev/kvm`, and it fetches a 67 MB engine on first use |
| `bwrap` | the workspace's own image in one long-lived bubblewrap sandbox per workspace (beta) | a user namespace, one image pull, and pasta for egress: `apt install bubblewrap passt`; no KVM, 1.1 ms per command, 82 MB of disk per workspace |
| `host` | no sandbox: the tools run on your machine | nothing, and it is not isolated |

```bash
./bin/acornfall workspace add demo ~/work/demo --sandbox bwrap   # or the engine switch on the create form
./bin/acornfall workspace add daemons ~/work/daemons --keep-alive  # a workspace that runs things
./bin/acornfall workspace list                                    # the engine is a column
ACORNFALL_IMAGE_TEST=1 make test                                  # the bwrap end-to-end tests, which fetch an image
```

A bwrap workspace gets its own copy of its image, so `apt install` works inside it and the
machine's own tools are never touched. Its network, when on, is a namespace of its own that
pasta forwards through the host: egress is the public internet, and the machine's own networks —
its LAN, link-local addresses, its tailnet — are refused inside the sandbox by route unless that
workspace was granted them (`--egress private`, or the dialog's *private networks* toggle)
([ADR 0025](docs/adr/0025-sandbox-egress.md)). The sandbox is one process per workspace with
acornfall itself as its first process inside, so a daemon a command starts keeps running, and
every engine has the same create / start / stop / remove lifecycle
([ADR 0024](docs/adr/0024-one-lifecycle.md)). What it gives up today: the copy costs its image's
size on disk ([ADR 0023](docs/adr/0023-bwrap-engine.md)).

A bwrap workspace also receives the host's `/dev/net/tun` and `/dev/kvm`, and the
capabilities nested pasta needs, so it can run another acornfall with its own bwrap engine
and network instead of falling back to the host. A workspace can withdraw them with
`acornfall workspace add --no-devices` (or `disable_devices` in the registry and the API);
the default is on, and a missing device is skipped rather than failing the boot. The inner
bwrap sandbox reuses the user namespace pasta already made, because a third user namespace
inside it cannot write its uid map. The outer workspace remains the boundary and its egress
policy is the ceiling ([ADR 0030](docs/adr/0030-nested-engines.md)). The KVM permission inside
a bwrap sandbox is proven; booting the microsandbox engine there is the next spike.

### Install from a release (one binary, no toolchain)

One line (the token rides along while the repo is private):

```bash
export ACORNFALL_GITHUB_TOKEN='...'   # fine-grained, read-only, this repo
curl -fsSL -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACORNFALL_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelowa/acornfall/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
# or with wget:
wget -qO- --header="Authorization: Bearer $ACORNFALL_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelowa/acornfall/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

By hand (same token header while private):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/acornfall/release && cd ~/acornfall/release
export ACORNFALL_GITHUB_TOKEN='...'
AUTH="Authorization: Bearer $ACORNFALL_GITHUB_TOKEN"
curl -sL -H "$AUTH" -o acornfall https://github.com/marcelowa/acornfall/releases/download/v0.9.5/acornfall-linux-amd64
curl -sL -H "$AUTH" -o sha256sums.txt https://github.com/marcelowa/acornfall/releases/download/v0.9.5/sha256sums.txt
sha256sum -c sha256sums.txt --ignore-missing   # must say OK
chmod +x acornfall
echo "$OPENCODE_API_KEY" | ./acornfall provider add opencode-go
./acornfall start
```

### Token (while the repo is private)

Releases are readable with a fine-grained token and nothing else:

1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens →
   Fine-grained tokens → Generate new token.
2. Resource owner: your account. Repository access: Only select
   repositories → `acornfall`.
3. Permissions → Contents: Read-only (Metadata comes along).
4. `export ACORNFALL_GITHUB_TOKEN='...'` where the gateway runs. The
   gateway reads it on every check, download, and checksum fetch.

Use ends when releases go public: unset the variable and the same
commands work without it. A token that was ever pasted into chat
should be rotated afterwards under the token's own settings.

First boot downloads a pinned bun once and the worker sources for its
tag, then installs dependencies — all under `~/.acornfall`, nothing on
the host. After that it self-updates from Settings > Updates: one
click, it restarts itself. Headless, `acornfall update` does the same thing: it checks, shows the
new tag and its first lines, and asks `install vX? [Y/n]` — `--yes` skips the question, `--check`
only reports. With no gateway running it installs to disk and takes effect at the next start.

Useful flags: `--data-dir <dir>` (default `~/.acornfall`), `--host` and `--port`
(default `0.0.0.0:7777`), `--workspaces-dir <dir>` (default `~/acornfall/workspaces`),
`--worker <command>` (a worker other than the ensured one).

The engine's store — images, workspace disks, snapshots — is `<data-dir>/sandboxes`, and a
sandbox's Unix socket lives in the session's runtime folder (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/acornfall`, or a
folder of this user's under the system temp directory). Sockets are not state and not
configuration, so neither has a flag; a machine that wants the store elsewhere can symlink it.

The default model is chosen with `acornfall model set <provider>/<modelId>` and read from
`<data-dir>/settings.json`, where the interface writes it too. Provider keys are
`acornfall provider add <provider>` (reads the key from stdin) — or with it in argv, for a
script that already has it.

The engine is a property of each workspace, recorded when the workspace is created (`acornfall
workspace add --sandbox …`), and a machine's default is what it can actually run. For a
development loop or a test, `ACORNFALL_SANDBOX_ENGINE` names one for the whole install: `host`
runs the tools on this machine with no isolation ([ADR 0015](docs/adr/0015-host-engine.md)).

Two environment variables cover what a service manager should not have to pass as flags:
`ACORNFALL_DATA_DIR` for the install folder and `ACORNFALL_WORKER` for the worker's sources. A flag
wins over the variable.

### Reaching it from another machine

The gateway listens on every interface and needs no token by default:

```bash
./bin/acornfall start           # binds 0.0.0.0:7777
```

Open `http://<machine>:7777` from another device. Anyone who can reach port 7777 gets the
console, its workspaces, and the provider key it spends, so keep that port on a network you
trust. See [ADR 0020](docs/adr/0020-open-by-default.md).

A token is opt-in. `--token <secret>` or `ACORNFALL_TOKEN` guards every request. A client
sends `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`, or opens `?token=<secret>` once, which sets an
HttpOnly cookie and redirects to `/` so the secret does not stay in the address bar.
EventSource cannot set headers, which is why the cookie exists.

To keep it off the network, bind loopback and use an SSH tunnel:

```bash
./bin/acornfall start --host 127.0.0.1
ssh -L 7777:127.0.0.1:7777 desktop
# then browse http://localhost:7777
```

### Secrets

A tool secret is a value a command needs, kept out of the transcript. Global entries are on
every workspace; a workspace entry with the same name wins. The agent can list names and
descriptions and ask for one through a card; the value goes to the gateway, never the model.
On microsandbox the guest environment holds the literal `$MSB_<NAME>`; a command sends that
value, for example `-H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN"`. The engine substitutes the
real value only for the allowed hosts, and only over HTTPS; plain HTTP is not intercepted.
`${NAME}` and `{{NAME}}` are not placeholders and pass through. An environment engine puts
the real value in the sandbox, and `allowEnv: false` keeps it out. See
[ADR 0021](docs/adr/0021-a-vault-for-tool-secrets.md).

A secret added while a conversation runs is stored first. The tool tells the agent to stop;
when the turn settles, the gateway restarts the sandbox and starts the next turn itself, so
the agent continues without you resending anything. The restart waits until no run is using
the workspace. Rotating an existing name is live, and adding a host or a name is what a
substitute engine cannot do without that brief restart. The value field hides by default and has an eye to reveal what you pasted. It carries the
common password-manager opt-outs, though Bitwarden on Firefox still prompts
([issue #100](https://github.com/marcelowa/acornfall/issues/100)); it is never inside a
submitting form. The default image has no `curl`; install one inside the sandbox or use the
project's own HTTPS client:

```bash
# inside the sandbox
apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
```

Settings > Secrets lists them; the conversation menu has the same page, and an agent that
needs one shows the card. The headless path reads the value from stdin:

```bash
acornfall secret add GITHUB_TOKEN --global --description "release token" \
  --hosts api.github.com,github.com < token.txt
acornfall secret list
acornfall secret show GITHUB_TOKEN      # what it is for, and where; never the value
```

A workspace secret names its workspace instead of its folder: `--workspace demo`.

### Without an API key

The dev provider answers every turn with one real `bash` call and a scripted
reply, so the whole path (tools, streaming, steering, usage) runs offline:

```bash
make dev
```

## What works

- **Multiple conversations** per workspace in the left rail, with a real id from the
  harness. Rename, branch, and delete from the rail; see
  [ADR 0005](docs/adr/0005-multi-conversation.md) and
  [ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-conversation-lifecycle.md). Branches fork *before* a user
  turn and hand that message back to the composer for editing.
- **Delete is a tombstone**, not a row delete: storage is append-only, so a deleted
  conversation keeps its transcript and is restorable from the rail.
- Streaming transcript with tool cards, live tool output, and a running/idle indicator.
- **Every pane is timestamped**, and a conversation header says whether it is working,
  when it last did, and what it has cost.
- **A conversation lives in the URL** (`/c/1276`), so several browser tabs can show
  different conversations at once, a reload lands where you were, and links are shareable.
  See [ADR 0010](docs/adr/0010-per-tab-attachments.md).
- **Formatted replies**: assistant text renders as Markdown (headings, lists, tables,
  fenced code, links) with a toggle back to the raw text. Tool output stays monospace
  with terminal escape codes stripped.
- **Steering**: type while a turn runs. The message queues visibly, then joins the
  running work after the current tool round.
- Abort, model switching, a thinking level populated from what the model actually
  supports, and per-turn usage.
- **Defaults** for model, thinking level, and agent, settable from the settings sheet for
  this workspace or for every one. A conversation that chose keeps its choice, a definition
  that names a model or level beats both, and below them the install default applies — and
  when nothing is set anywhere, a preferred model rather than whichever happens to be listed
  first. See [ADR 0007](docs/adr/0007-model-defaults.md).
- **Context inspector**: the prompt sections and tool schemas the last request was
  actually sent, estimated tokens per section, and what changed since the previous
  request.
- **Agent definitions** with a global/workspace/agent overlay, and an explain view
  showing which layer contributed what. See `docs/adr/0004-resource-overlay.md`.
- **Workspaces**: a folder, its own `AGENTS.md`, config, agents, skills, and commands — under
  `.agents/` (the ecosystem's name, so a bundle written for another harness works) or
  `.acornfall/`, which wins when a folder has both. Each workspace runs its own
  worker and storage, started on first use. See `docs/adr/0011-workspaces.md`.
- **Sandboxed execution**: what the agent *runs* runs in a microVM — one per workspace, the
  workspace mounted read-write at its own path and the global resource folders (`~/.agents`,
  the install's agents/skills/prompts/commands) read-only at theirs, nothing else, no network —
  and so does every file the agent reads or writes. The worker stays outside it, next to the
  provider key. A skill's script therefore runs where its instructions say it lives, while the
  install's credentials, token, and state are not paths inside the guest. When the engine
  or the hypervisor is missing the tools refuse rather than run on the host; `acornfall doctor`
  says which it is. `ACORNFALL_SANDBOX_ENGINE=host` is the explicit alternative for a machine without a
  hypervisor or a fast development loop: the tools run on the host, unconfined, and the state
  and doctor say so. A workspace nests virtual machines — runs a hypervisor inside
  its sandbox — when the engine offers it and the machine can grant it, unless nesting is
  disabled in the workspace; when it cannot, the sandbox boots without it and doctor and the
  state say why. See `docs/adr/0012-sandbox.md`,
  `docs/adr/0014-global-resources-in-the-sandbox.md`, `docs/adr/0015-host-engine.md`, and
  `docs/adr/0018-disable-vm-nesting.md`.
- **Slash commands** from `<home>/commands/`, `~/.agents/commands/`, and the workspace's
  `.agents/` or `.acornfall/` — under `commands/` or, since it is the same thing by another
  name, `prompts/` — expanded server-side so the transcript records what the model saw.
- **Guards**: declarative rules that block a tool call and say why — a command pattern, or a
  path outside the workspace — accumulating across layers and visible in the inspector.
- **Workspaces are managed from the interface**: create by name inside the workspaces folder
  (`--workspaces-dir`, default `~/acornfall/workspaces`), and forget one (which never deletes
  the folder or the history). Pointing a workspace at a folder elsewhere is
  `acornfall workspace add <name> <folder>`, because the interface stays inside one
  directory.
- **Delegation**: `delegate` hands a task to a subagent and waits; `subagent` starts one
  that keeps working while you answer and reports back when it is done, waking the parent
  to act on it. `peer: true` creates a *normal* conversation instead — it appears in your
  rail marked as agent-created, outlives its creator, and can have subagents of its own.
  Ownership, depth, peer ceilings, reachability, and the wake budget are configurable in
  the overlay and visible in the inspector's Delegation card. See
  `docs/adr/0008-delegation.md`.
- Provider connect/disconnect from the UI, 42 providers, 60+ models each where the key allows.
- **Recovery**: if the harness process dies the gateway says so ("harness down" with the
  reason), restarts it with backoff, and resumes every run from its last commit — about
  two seconds. The stream sends a keepalive and the client reconnects on its own.
  See [ADR 0009](docs/adr/0009-liveness-and-recovery.md).
- Credentials live in `~/.acornfall/credentials.json` (0600), never in the worker's home.
- **Self-update**: the gateway checks GitHub releases hourly (plus a Refresh button).
  A header dot (count 1) leads to Settings > Updates: current tag, new tag, notes,
  backup note, Update now / Later. Backup (config, state DB, workspace list, last 3)
  runs first and stops the update on failure; VM disks are not backed up. Keep VMs is
  the default; Start clean wipes the sandbox root only. A running conversation blocks
  with a choice: wait for drain, stop runs and update, or cancel. The new binary
  migrates at boot (`scripts/migrate/<tag>.sh`, non-zero stops boot) and `GET /healthz`
  must pass for 30s; failure restores `acornfall.bak` and names the cause on the screen.
  Pin a tag for no prompts. While the repo is private, set `ACORNFALL_GITHUB_TOKEN`
  (read-only, one repo) so the check, download, and checksum fetch can read releases;
  drop it when releases go public. See [ADR 0019](docs/adr/0019-self-update.md).

## Write an agent

`~/.acornfall/agents/<name>.md` (global) or `<workspace>/.agents/agents/<name>.md`
(workspace, shadows a global definition of the same name). The workspace bundle may also be
`<workspace>/.acornfall/`, and that one wins when both exist: `.agents` is the ecosystem's
name — a bundle written for another harness works here, and `~/.agents/skills/` is read too —
while `.acornfall` is where you keep what is yours alone:

```markdown
---
name: researcher
description: Reads before it writes
thinking: medium
allow-tools: read, bash, skill
deny-tools: write, edit
---
You are a researcher. Read before you answer, and name the paths you relied on.
```

`config.json` in the same two locations carries defaults for every agent in scope:

```json
{ "defaults": { "instructions": "…", "denyTools": ["bash"] } }
```

Then pick the agent in the top bar. **Reload files** in the inspector re-reads them
without restarting anything. Resolution rules and their rationale are in
[ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-resource-overlay.md).

## What does not exist yet

Memory, MCP, codemode, multi-user, triggers, versioned agent definitions, and the parts of
the interface that are being rebuilt. `docs/adr/` holds the designs they will land against;
ADR 0012 lists what the sandbox deliberately does not cover yet.

## Development

```bash
make check         # fast: the compiler and the unit tests, no processes (~6s)
make lint          # the static rules: gofmt, vet, staticcheck, tsc, oxlint, oxfmt
make modernize     # the Go idiom analyzer; a daily workflow prompts with it, the gate does not
make test          # the default gate: units + the feature suite, no hypervisor (~30s)
make test-sandbox  # the microVM engine boundary: live driver + SDK + 4 e2e tests (~35s; needs /dev/kvm)
make ui            # drives the real client in headless chromium (needs a running gateway)
make build         # gateway build
make dev           # dev provider + gateway, workspace = current directory
```

`docs/engineering/standards.md` is what the code is held to, rule by rule, with the check that
enforces each and the bug behind the ones that matter. `make tools` installs the linters.

`docs/features.md` is the inventory: what the platform does, stated as things that are
observable, and the test that covers each one. Read it before changing behaviour, and add to it
when adding a feature.

The end-to-end tests (`gateway/internal/e2e`) run a real gateway and a real worker against a
scripted provider, so nothing calls a model and nothing needs a network. They need `bun` and
`make deps`; without them they skip with a reason. `make test` runs them with the sandbox tier
forced off, so the tools take the refusal path and the command behaves the same everywhere;
`make test-sandbox` runs them against real microVMs where there is a hypervisor — the tiers
are [ADR 0013](docs/adr/0013-test-tiers.md). A feature driven by a tool call — a guard
blocking one, a subagent being spawned — is driven by `ACORNFALL_DEV_SCRIPT`, a JSON file of
rules matched against the last user message; see `docs/features.md`.

The Markdown renderer in `ui/src/components/transcript/render-markdown.ts` **escapes the source
once, up front**, and every later step operates on escaped text. Model output and tool output
are untrusted — a tool result can contain anything a file or a command produced — so raw HTML
must never survive, link targets are scheme-checked rather than passed through, and images are
refused outright: a remote image in a reply is fetched by your browser, which is a way to
signal information outward. The checks for all of that live in
`ui/test/render-markdown.test.ts` under jsdom, because the sanitiser needs a DOM — and needs
one whose parser it can trust.

`make ui` exists because two bugs shipped that curl could not see: an element looked up
but never declared, and a modal whose visibility an author rule silently overrode. It
drives the served interface in a real browser: the splitter resizes the rail and the width
comes back after a reload, transcript items are neither squashed nor clipped, pane
controls are per pane, the theme toggle persists, and the phone gets a drawer instead of a
rail eating the transcript. The inspector and settings-sheet checks arrive with #13.

The worker protocol is defined once per language — `worker/src/protocol.ts` and
`gateway/internal/protocol/protocol.go` — and documented in `docs/adr/0002-layers-and-protocol.md`.
