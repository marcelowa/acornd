/**
 * A readable measure. Text that runs the full width of a 27-inch screen is harder to read,
 * but this interface is mostly code, tool output, and diffs — content that a prose column
 * wastes space on. Four widths, then: `prose` for a text-only context, `wide` for a columned
 * page, `page` for a surface that owns its whole screen, and `full` for the conversation pane,
 * where a tool's output is the thing being read and a capped column would hold back the one
 * content that wants the room. The pane constrains whichever one is asked for, so a phone just
 * gets the full width either way.
